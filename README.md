**Instructions for use**

Insert a set of two commands, separated by spaces, in the command line argument along with the run-file argument. The first argument should be a declaration about what form you want to convert to, either: "ascii", "braille", or "unicode". The second argument should be some set of numbers/letters in either braille or ASCII form. The program will then do the conversion, printing the data in converted form or providing appropriate error messages.
